    <h3>
        What is HTML ?
    </h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>HTML is an initialism for "HyperText Markup Language"</li>
        <li>It is the language of the web.</li>
        <li>It is used to create websites</li>
        <li>It is used to define a page layout, meaning it is a barebone page structure</li>
        <li>HTML is used for making pages of the website also called webpages that we see on 
            the internet</li>
          <li>It consists of a set of tags</li>  
          <li>This set of tags is written in HTML Document.</li>
          <li> ".html" or ".htm" is the extension</li>
          <li> There are so many versions of HTML but HTML5 is the latest version</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Why the word HyperText & Markup Language</h3>
    
    <p>The word hypertext markup language comprises the words “hypertext” and “markup 
        language”. The term "hypertext" refers to the linking of text with other documents 
        and “markup language” refers to a language that uses a set of tags.
    <br>
    So, HTML is the linking of text with other documents using some set of tags <br>
<br>Note:- Tags refers to some meaningful texts enclosed in angle braces <...>. For eg. <head>. 
    Each tag has a different meaning and importance in building an HTML page which can affect 
    the web page in its own ways</p>
    
   <center> <img src= "img 1.png" ></center><br>
   
   <p>Here in the explanation for the above analogy, the car skeleton refers to HTML with the 
    page body. When that skeleton is painted it the car gets CSS and after all that car is provided 
    with some functionalities like engine, etc (which refers to JavaScript), the car gets life and 
    can run. Similarly, when we develop our websites we need HTML for the structure and if we 
    want our website to look good and prettier we need CSS and if we want to add 
    functionalities to our webpage we need JavaScript.</p>
